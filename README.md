# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Required Updates for Amazon Linux 2 Platform - DO NOT SKIP
updated 8-12-2021

When creating our Elastic Beanstalk environment in the next lecture, we need to select Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2 and make a few changes to our project:


This new AWS platform will conflict with the project we have built since it will look for a docker.compose.yml file to build from by default instead of a Dockerfile.

To resolve this, please do the following:

1. Rename the development Compose config file

Rename the docker-compose.yml file to docker-compose-dev.yml. Going forward you will need to pass a flag to specify which compose file you want to build and run from:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down

2. Create a production Compose config file

Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root of the project and paste the following:

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - '80:80'
AWS EBS will see a file named docker-compose.yml and use it to build the single container application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
